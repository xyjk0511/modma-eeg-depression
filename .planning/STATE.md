**Current focus:** Phase 1: QC Repair

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (QC Repair)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-02-22 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 phases derived from 12 requirements (QC -> Preprocessing -> Features -> Validation)
- 01-01: Per-window QC discards any window with >0 channels exceeding 200uV post-interpolation
- 01-01: Dynamic max_bad_channels (12% of n_channels) overrides CLI value

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: pyprep RANSAC requires highpass BEFORE detection (MODMA EDF DC offset)
- Research flag: ICLabel on EGI-128 montage needs empirical validation on 2-3 subjects
