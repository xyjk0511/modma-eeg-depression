# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Fix QC parameters to retain enough subjects for MDD vs HC classification
**Current focus:** Phase 1: QC Repair

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (QC Repair) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-22 — Completed 01-02-PLAN.md

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 8.5 min
- Total execution time: 0.28 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1-QC Repair | 2/2 | 17 min | 8.5 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 phases derived from 12 requirements (QC -> Preprocessing -> Features -> Validation)
- 01-01: Per-window QC discards any window with >0 channels exceeding 200uV post-interpolation
- 01-01: Dynamic max_bad_channels (12% of n_channels) overrides CLI value
- 01-02: Per-window QC threshold changed from zero-tolerance to 12% to match Raw-level gate
- 01-02: Group retention stats (mdd_rate, hc_rate, diff) saved to metrics.json

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: pyprep RANSAC requires highpass BEFORE detection (MODMA EDF DC offset)
- Research flag: ICLabel on EGI-128 montage needs empirical validation on 2-3 subjects
